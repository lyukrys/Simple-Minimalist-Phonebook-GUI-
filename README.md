A Minimalists phonebook (GUI)

#########################################################################

USE:

Enter text only into the First&Last Name field, then enter the desired phonenumber WITHOUT dashes. 
To delete just simply click on the desired contact to be deleted, when you close the windows everything
will be automatically saved, even if the windows is closed by a power outage or something else causes
it to be closed. Instead of clicking the ENTER button, you just simply press ENTER (tip: use TAB to switch
between the two fields).

If you have any tips on how I could improve this please tell me,

Thank You!
